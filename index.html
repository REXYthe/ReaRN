        I'm not on your radar? Then your radar's broke
        Don't blame me for the way y'alls jokes
        Fall flat, get your mouth slapped, ain't no hoax
        I get an inkling, they picked me for the weak link
        I'm gonna have to pose
        A question for the ones that don't accept that I've been exceptional
        'Cause the moment I get involved is the moment a song takes off
        So how could you think I wouldn't last long in a game
        That I was made to play? What do y'all take me for?
        Rest assured
        When I do come back to tour, it'll be Christmas morning
        In a way 'cause I'ma wake up with a present so big, they'll jump for joy
        Yeah, let it be known, I'm better when I'm outta control
        I can not be the butt of a joke
        I'm cutting in the front of you posers talkin' like you really a pro
        When you ain't even part of the convo
        Nothin' but an amateur, I'll slow down when I want it colossal
        Only way to put it if I chose
        I could be bigger, maybe consider it a bit if it was helpin' you all
        To comprehend, you condescend (you're gone)
        Incompetent, the consequences (are)
        Hard to miss, it's common sense (I'm on)
        One, so wrap your head around it (or)
        I might have to get up off the porch
        Show you how it's done, I got the form
        Power trippin' on me, get destroyed
        Pull the plug, I'm rollin' up your cord
        Fool me once, shame on you
        Fool me twice, shame on you
        Fool me three times, hold up, rewind
        That's not even possible
        Me, I keep it honorable
        Who's your favorite? Let me know
        Tally up, count the votes
        Wasn't me? That's a joke
        Yeah, ayy, that's a joke
        That's a, that's a joke
        Funny, yeah, that's a joke
        That's a, that's a joke
        Funny, woo, that's a joke
        That's a, that's a joke
        Funny, ayy, that's a joke
        That's a joke
        Yeah, I took a minute now, I'm at the better end of all of it
        The day I wanna quit'll be a bitter one to swallow
        'Cause I meant it when I said I wasn't really into audibles
        I guess you gotta call 'em when your odds are at the bottom
        And it's stackin' up against you, it's a pity, but they gotta give a nod to me
        I'm runnin' with the best, I been the kind to make a profit
        Off of everything that you told me was impossible
        So why would you continue with the narrative
        And not admit I'm someone incredible, look of a general
        Hit 'em with the end of shovel, they wanna forget it
        I put 'em on the ground and I get up and open the pit of my stomach
        To remind 'em again I'm a whole different animal
        Whatever the case, I'ma get it, I'm in it, no doubt, I would give it
        Everything if I gotta, but not if the commas
        Are pushin' me to run with the common, the jokin' aside
        If you took away the dummies and bias, you'll notice that I'm insane (insane)
        Improved a lot, but I still feel
        It's hard to keep my lid from poppin' off, but I prevail
        How you gonna skip over the details
        And tell me to be focused? Hold that thought
        Don't tell me you mean well if you don't mean well
        I call the shots, but don't need my hand held
        When it comes to makin' records
        Who you know that does that better?
        The way I connect letters
        You'd think that the alphabet was made by me
        When it comes to storytellin', I'm great at it
        Tune in or get tuned out, my face got redder
        'Cause I'm embarrassed for the ones unaware of my work
        What, did I stutter?
        Known to be cordial
        But those that think that never seen me in a war zone
        My delivery gets better every time I spit
        I don't keep my sword low
        Tell me why would I do that?
        Doesn't make sense when you're in a game this cutthroat
        If you wanna maintain control, then you gotta keep up
        If you can't handle the workload
        Somebody else will
        How could you call me unskilled?
        That's like lookin' at Mount Everest and then calling it a small hill
        Not at all thrilled, I'm in awe still
        Tryin' not to laugh, but it just spills
        Out sometimes, I been writin' chill
        Just chew on this 'til the record's built, okay
        Fool me once, shame on you
        Fool me twice, shame on you (on you)
        Fool me three times, hold up, rewind
        That's not even possible
        Me, I keep it honorable (okay)
        Who's your favorite? Let me know (let me know)
        Tally up, count the votes
        Wasn't me? That's a joke
        Yeah, ayy, that's a joke (joke)
        That's a, that's a joke (joke)
        Funny, yeah, that's a joke (joke)
        That's a, that's a joke (joke)
        Funny, woo, that's a joke (joke)
        That's a, that's a joke (joke)
        Funny, ayy, that's a joke
        That's a joke

        "Hey, Nate, how's life?"
        I don't know, it's alright
        I've been dealin' with some things like every human being
        And really didn't sleep much last night (last night)
        "I'm sorry", that's fine
        I just think I need a little me time
        I just think I need a little free time
        Little break from the shows and the bus rides (bus rides), yeah
        Last year I had a breakdown
        Thoughts tellin' me I'm lost gettin' too loud
        Had to see a therapist, then I found out
        Somethin' funny's goin' on up in my house
        Yeah, I started thinkin' maybe I should move out
        You know, pack my car, take a new route
        Clean up my yard, get the noose out
        Hang up my heart, let it air out (air out)
        I've been searchin'
        "What does that mean, Nate?"
        I've been learning
        Grabbin' my keepsakes, leavin' my burdens
        Well, I brought a few with me, I'm not perfect
        Lookin' at the view like, this concerns me
        Pickin' up the cues, right? I'm quite nervous
        Hate it when I lose sight, life gets blurry
        And things might hurt me
        It's prolly gonna be a long journey, but hey (but hey)
        It's worth it, though
        Cold world out there, kids, grab your coats
        Been a minute, I know, now I'm back to roam
        Lookin' for the antidote to crack the code
        Pretty vivid, I admit it, I'm in classic mode
        Don't need pity given to me, but I can't condone
        Talkin' down to me, I'ma have to crack your nose for crackin' jokes
        I'm lookin' for the map to hope, you seen it? (You seen it?)
        Been makin' a whole lot of changes
        Wrote a song about that, you should play it
        I get scared when I walk on these stages
        I look at the crowd and see so many faces, yeah
        That's when I start to get anxious
        That's when my thoughts can be dangerous
        That's when I put on my makeup and drown in self-hatred
        Forget what I'm saying, and
        Where'd the beat go?
        Oh, ain't that somethin'?
        Drums came in, you ain't see that comin'
        Hands on my head, can't tell me nothin'
        Got a taste of the fame, had to pump my stomach
        Throw it back up like I don't want it
        Wipe my face, clean up my vomit
        OCD, tryna push my buttons
        I said don't touch it, now y'all done it
        I can be critical, never typical
        Intricate with every syllable, I'm a criminal
        Intimate, but never political, pretty visual
        Even if you hate it, I'll make it feel like you're in it, though
        You call me what you wanna, but never call me forgettable
        Leave you deep in thought, I could never swim in the kiddie pool
        Way that I been thinkin' is cinematic, it's beautiful
        Man, I don't know if I'm makin' movies or music videos (videos, videos, videos)
        Yeah, the sales can rise
        Doesn't mean much though when your health declines
        See, we've all got somethin' that we trapped inside
        That we try to suffocate, you know, hopin' it dies
        Try to hold it underwater but it always survives
        Then it comes up out of nowhere like an evil surprise
        Then it hovers over you to tell you millions of lies
        You don't relate to that? Must not be as crazy as I am
        The point I'm makin' is the mind is a powerful place
        And what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way
        It's pretty cool, right? Yeah, but it's not always safe
        Just hang with me, this'll only take a moment, okay?
        Just think about it for a second, if you look at your face
        Every day when you get up and think you'll never be great
        You'll never be great, not because you're not, but the hate
        Will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith (woo!)
        I am developin', take a look at the benefits
        Nothin' to meddle with, I can never be delicate
        Am I even relevant? That depends how you measure it
        Take a measurement, then bag it up and give me the evidence
        Pretty evident, dependable can never be tentative
        I'm a gentleman, depending on if I think you're genuine
        Pretty elegant, but not afraid to tell you to get a grip
        Proper etiquette, I keep it to myself when I celebrate, ah (ah)
        It's that time again
        Better grab your balloons and invite your friends
        Seatbelts back on, yeah, strap 'em in
        Look at me, everybody, I'm smilin' big
        On a road right now that I can't predict
        Tell me "Tone that down, " but I can't resist
        Y'all know that sound, better raise your fist
        The search begins, I'm back, so enjoy the trip, huh

    <h3 id="hope">Hope</h3><a href="#top">Top</a>
    <p><pre>
        Hope
        I'm on my way, I'm coming
        Don't, don't lose faith in me
        I know you've been waitin'
        I know you've been prayin' for my soul
        Hope, hope
        Thirty years you been draggin' your feet
        Tellin' me I'm the reason we're stagnant
        Thirty years you've been claimin' your rightness
        And promisin' progress, but where's it at?
        I don't want you to feel like a failure (failure)
        I know this hurts (hurts)
        But I gave you your chance to deliver (deliver)
        Now it's my turn
        Don't get me wrong, Nate, you've had a great run
        But it's time to give the people somethin' different
        So without further ado, I'd
        Like to introduce my
        (My album, my album, my album, my album, my album, my album, my album)
        Hope
        What's my definition of success? (Success)
        Listening to what your heart says (the heart says)
        Standing up for what you know is (is)
        Right, while everybody else is (is)
        Tucking their tail between their legs (okay)
        What's my definition of success? (Success)
        Creating something no one else can (else can)
        Bein' brave enough to dream big (big)
        Grindin' when you're told to just quit (quit)
        Givin' more when you got nothin' left (left)
        It's a person that'll take a chance on
        Somethin' they were told could never happen
        It's a person that can see the bright side through the dark times when there ain't one
        It's when someone who ain't never had nothin'
        Ain't afraid to walk away from more profit
        'Cause they'd rather do somethin' that they really love and take the paycut
        It's a person that would never waiver
        Or change who they are
        Just to try and gain some credibility
        So they could feel accepted by a stranger
        It's a person that can take the failures in their life and turn them into motivation
        It's believing in yourself when no one else does, it's amazing
        What a little bit of faith can do if you don't even believe in you
        Why would you think or expect anybody else that's around you to?
        I done did things that I regret
        I done said things I can't take back
        Was a lost soul at a cross road who had no hope but I changed that
        I spent years of my life holdin' on to things I never should've kept, full of hatred
        Years of my life carryin' a lot of baggage that I should've walked away from
        Years of my life wishin' I was someone different, lookin' for some validation
        Years of my life tryna fill the void, pretending I was in
        They get it
        Growing pain's a necessary evil
        Difficult to go through, yes, but beneficial
        Some would say having a mental breakdown is a negative thing which on one hand I agree with
        On the other hand, it was the push I needed to get help and start the healing process, see
        If I'd have never hit rock bottom
        Would I be the person that I am today?
        I don't believe so
        I'm a prime example of what happens when you choose to not accept defeat and face your demons
        Took me thirty years to realize that if you want to get the opportunity
        To be the greatest version of yourself
        Sometimes you got to be someone you're not to hear the voice of reason
        Having kids will make you really take a step back and look in the mirror
        At least for me that's what it did, I
        Wake up every day and pick my son up, hold him in my arms
        And let him know he's loved (loved)
        Standing by the window questioning if dad is ever going to show up (up)
        Isn't something he's goin' to have to worry about
        Don't get it twisted, that wasn't a shot
        Mama, I forgive you
        I just don't want him to grow up thinkin' that he'll never be enough (enough)
        Thirty years of running, thirty years of searching
        Thirty years of hurting, thirty years of pain
        Thirty years of fearful, thirty years of anger
        Thirty years of empty, thirty years of shame
        Thirty years of broken, thirty years of anguish
        Thirty years of hopeless, thirty years of (hey)
        Thirty years of never, thirty years of maybe
        Thirty years of later, thirty years of fake
        Thirty years of hollow, thirty years of sorrow
        Thirty years of darkness, thirty years of (Nate)
        Thirty years of baggage, thirty years of sadness
        Thirty years of stagnant, thirty years of chains
        Thirty years of anxious, thirty years of suffering
        Thirty years of torment, thirty years of (wait)
        Thirty years of bitter, thirty years of lonely
        Thirty years of pushing everyone away
        (You'll never evolve) I know I can change
        (We are not enough) we are not the same
        (You don't have the heart) you don't have the strength
        (You don't have the will) you don't have the faith
        (You'll never be loved) you'll never be safe
        (Might as well give up) not running away
        (You don't have the guts) you're the one afraid
        I'm the one in charge
        I'm taking the (no)
        I'm taking the
        Reigns
